ShortViz
ShortViz is a web application that visualizes sorting algorithms. It provides an interactive platform to understand and observe the step-by-step
process of popular sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort.

Deployment
The project is deployed and accessible at: https://hritick1.github.io/Sorting-Visualiser/

Features
Sorting Algorithm Visualization: ShortViz enables users to visualize sorting algorithms in action, helping them gain insights into the sorting process.
Interactive Controls: Users can control the sorting speed, pause and resume the visualization, and step through each iteration, allowing for a more
comprehensive understanding.
Multiple Sorting Algorithms: ShortViz supports various sorting algorithms, including bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort, 
providing users with options to compare and contrast different approaches.
Real-time Data Representation: The application dynamically updates and represents the sorting progress, allowing users to observe the changes in real-time.
Technologies Used
HTML: Used for the structure and layout of the web pages.
CSS: Applied for styling and visual enhancements.
JavaScript: Implemented the sorting algorithms and interactive functionalities.
Bootstrap: Utilized for responsive design and layout components.

Usage
Access the ShortViz application through the deployment link: https://hritick1.github.io/Sorting-Visualiser/

Select a sorting algorithm from the available options.
Click on the "Visualise" button to initiate the visualization.
Observe the sorting process visually as the elements get rearranged.
